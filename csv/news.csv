After a mild correction last week, the XTZ/USD pair has resumed its up move. It can now move up to the overhead resistance at $1.85. The price had turned down from $1.85 on two previous occasions. Hence, this level will again act as a major hurdle. If the price reverses from $1.85, it will extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.
However, if the bulls can push the price above $1.85, the pair will start a new uptrend that can carry the price to $2.87 and above it to $3.37. Conversel",Bitcoin is at a critical level.

Bitcoin slumped to a six-month low on Friday after China's central bank launched a fresh crackdown on cryptocurrencies, warning of the risks entailed in issuing or trading them. Bitcoin, the world's biggest cryptocurrency, fell nine percent to $6,929 (roughly Rs. 4,97,400), its lowest since May, and was last down seven percent at $7,107 (roughly Rs. 5,10,200). The People's Bank of China's Shanghai headquarters said it would tackle growing cases of illegality involving virtual currencies. It also cautioned investors not to confuse crypto with blockchain technology, the digital ledger that underpins many cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.
The move came a day after regulators in Shenzhen launched a similar campaign, and came as the PBOC prepares to launch its own digital currency.

Bitcoin's sell-off deepened on Friday, putting the digital token at the lowest level since May, after it dropped below yet another key support level.
The world's most-traded cryptocurrency declined as much as 11% to $6,798, before trimming losses. Alternative coins such as Ether and Litecoin also slumped. For the first time since April, Bitcoin fell below its 200-day moving average without bouncing back, a signal that traders see the breach as a sign of weakness rather than an opportunity to buy.
Feeding the anxiety were lingering concerns about the status of exchanges such as Binance Holdings Ltd. in China after officials there formally announced a crackdown on crypto-related businesses. Binance has denied reports of a police raid of offices in Shanghai, saying it doesn't have formal operations there as of now.

Hello traders everywhere. Bitcoin's price has briefly dropped below $7,000, hitting an intra-day low of $6,785, its lowest level since May 17, 2019, when it hit a low of $6,178. This move lower has wiped out the +30% single-day gain on Oct. 25, 2019, that had pulled Bitcoin out of a long-term downtrend or bear market. Bitcoin triggered a new red weekly Trade Triangle at the beginning of the week, signaling entry into a long-term downtrend and indicating that a move lower could be on the horizon. That was the start of what would be a -15% loss for the week.
What's ahead for Bitcoin? With this move lower Bitcoin is now trading below its 50-day MA, the MACD has turned lower, and the RSI is no below the 30 level which would lead you to believe that a move lower in on the horizon. Our key level to watch will be $9,586.50. A move above that level will trigger a green weekly Trade Triangle indicating a move to a sidelines position.

Two popular investment avenues, real estate and bitcoin, have been making waves in todays market. When it comes to these opportunities, it can be difficult to discern which is the wiser investment choice for you. Both have benefits and, like all investments, carry risk.
If you have been considering these assets and are looking to select the option thats a good fit for you, lets examine the pros and cons of each investment. Keep in mind before making any investment decisions to perform your due diligence and consult your financial advisor.

Bitcoin has continued its four-week downtrend after a further 2.5% slump this morning, with a $2,000 move to the downside becoming increasingly likely.
The $7,900 level of support is now being tested for the first time since October 23. A breakdown from this level could pave the way for a cataclysmic correction to the historic $5,900 level of support.
The next logical stopping point for Bitcoin, if $7,900 is indeed broken to the downside, would be $7,400, which is the same level that spurred a 40% rally to the upside on October 25.

At the time of writing, a minor recovery can be spotted with Bitcoin holding above the 23.6% Fib resistance level taken between the last swing high of $10,522 to a swing low of $7,281. It is apparent that Bitcoin bulls must maintain the price above $8,000 to avoid the devastating grip that would see the price plunge to the possible bounce/buy zone at $7,200.
At the moment, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is in the oversold region. A visible minor recover targeting shows that buying activity is gaining traction. However, to be on the safe side, the RSI must break the high pattern it has been forced to formed since October 26.
On the upside, defending $8,000 support is key for reversal if the buyers want to avoid the $7,000 range altogether. This will also bank on the ability for Bitcoin to recover above $8,400 and $8,800 respectively. Besides, it is clear that the journey to $9,000 will not be a smooth ride.

XRP Ledger allows for the creation of other tokens to be set up and traded against stocks on the network. According to Bob, this is one huge factor that contributed to the exchanges decision to choose the XRP network.

Since the Sologenic platform will run on the XRP network, it means that there will be only two cryptos against which stocks can be traded. CoinFields token is named SOLO. To that effect, stocks will be traded against SOLO and XRP.

Litecoin saw a sharp price decline of around 12% over the past 24 hours and it currently trades at $46.34. LTC is now down by a total of 21% over the past week which is largely a result of Bitcoin dropping by 10% in a day.

Litecoin (LTC) has diminished its status as a highly secure network, as the lowered hashrate following the reward halving is seen as a threat for double-spending. LTC was the only asset for which Coinbase increased the requisite number of confirmations from 3 to 6.

Ethereum Classic (ETC) remains a problematic asset, as it has already suffered an attack with double spending. Still, Coinbase decreased the requirement from 5676 confirmations down to 3527. This still means a significant number of blocks must pass until a transaction is accepted as valid.

Litecoin,"LTC Rolls Over After Reaching 100-Day EMA, Can The Bulls Bring Us Back Above $60?",2019-11-14,"What has been going on?
Since our
previous Litecoin analysis
, we can see that Litecoin continued slightly lower beneath the support at $51.84, but managed to find lower support at $47.60. After reaching this level, Litecoin rebounded higher toreach $63 before the close of October.
As November progressed, we can see that Litecoin has risen further higher but was rejected by resistance at the 100-dayEMA level at around $67. Litecoin has since rolled over as it trades beneath $60 again at the $59.51 level.
Litecoin price short-term prediction:
Bearish
Litecoin is most certainly within a bearish short-term trend. For this bearish trend to continue, we would need to see the market fall further beneath the $47.60 level.

Its a question being asked by researchers at The University of New Mexico, who are investigating the environmental impacts of mining cryptocurrencies.

However, it is a positive sign that Bitcoin is currently holding in the upper percentile of the Bollinger Bands as the resistance that Bitcoin needs to break to begin a new upward trend is at $9,900.

Last week Trustnodes reported that the Litecoin Foundation was down from more than one million in income last year to $70,000 in minus this year. It went on to tout figures about t-shirt sales being the only source of revenue for the project.
An expensive looking

We Are Not Bankrupt
Responding to comments on twitter regarding bankruptcy, Lee added;
Its not near bankruptcy. Dont listen to stupid fud and lies. We have enough money to last 2 years.

The altcoin market is illiquid, and takes very little capital to have a dramatic impact, hence the occurrence of what the crypto community refers to as alt seasons. With two years of bear market and sell pressure potentially completely exhausting the market of sellers, it may finally be time for these beaten and battered assets to return to a bull market.

Alternatively, the renewed bearish sentiment around Bitcoin could not only prevent altcoins from regaining the value they lost during the downtrend, but it could drag alts down further into oblivion. With many of them still down 99% from their all-time highs, its difficult to imagine they have further to fall, but in the crypto market, anything is possible.

Litecoin,Bitcoin & Litecoin wallets less secure on iPhone X and older,2019-09-29,"September 27, 2019
The news comes after Twitter user @axi0mX released an open-source iOS jailbreaking software which allows hardware-level jailbreaking of the iPhone. Affected chipsets range from iPhone 4S (A5 chip) to iPhone X (A11 Chip). iPads released before 2019 are also at risk.
Due to the jailbreaking software chipset, an attacker can gain root access for chipsets older than A11. Root access to a device can give an attacker access to private keys stored on a device. The attacker would require a physical presence of the device to exploit though. Loshan also adds that the issue cannot be fixed by a software patch.
According to research conducted by Litecoin Foundation, the majority of the users using Loafwallet (Litecoin wallet from Litecoin Foundation) are iOS users.

The interpretation is always an issue because its very subjective. However, there is little to be subjective about  this column of Os is most definitely a pole. Why? Because it is the single largest percentage loss column on this charts history. We are, literally, looking at the single most bearish bear column in Litecoins history! I admit to being kind of surprised when I was doing the analysis, but it is the worst by far at a -31.17% drop. The question is: So where is the entry?

Cryptocurrencies extended Tuesdays slide as Bitcoin dropped below $9,000 for the first time since June.
Bitcoin tumbled as much as 17% to $8,087, the most on an intraday basis since January 2018. So-called alternative coins such as Ether and Litecoin slumped even more, declining as much as 25% and 21%, respectively.
As often is the case with digital assets, multiple reasons are being cited by traders for the decline, from the lackluster introduction of one-day Bitcoin deliverable futures Monday to a general risk-off atmosphere with U.S. equity markets taking a downturn Tuesday afternoon.
Price action is being driven by short-term technical analysis right now, as every low price that Bitcoin has bounced off of, and every high price that has been reached has proven to be resistance, Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, a Los Angeles-based asset manager that invests in cryptocurrencies, said in an email.

Bitcoin prices cratered over 10% on Tuesday as an area of longstanding support around $9,545 was breached. The initial break was gradual but bears quickly took control and pressured prices comfortably beneath the area of technical support  resulting in the subsequent bloodbath. Falling from $9,300 to $8,600 in just 15 minutes, the afternoon price action was enough to put BTCUSD on pace for its worst daily performance since July 16 when the coin dropped more than 13%.
