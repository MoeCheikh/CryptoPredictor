Negative influence on the dynamics can have a large number of short positions in the CME.\nThe round level at $8,000 is an important psychological support factor.

Almost immediately below this mark - around $7,900 - there is a 200-day simple moving average. This is a fundamental signal level, which has stopped the sell-offs several times before.
